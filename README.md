# Collapse / Expand Sidebar Menu Using JavaScript, HTML, & CSS

Learn how to collapse / expand a sidebar menu using JavaScript, HTML, & CSS only. In this tutorial, we will build a fully responsive sidebar menu that can be expanded and collapsed using a button. This is commonly seen on modern administration dashboards.

Using CSS and JS we make our sidebar menu look tremendous and functional with a search bar/popup. I also tested and coded for responsive media queries so not only does it work on desktops, but also on mobile phones so your sidebar panel can look great for your entire project. Keep in mind this is a look-only tutorial but you can use it as a the basis for your entire project's navigation.
